# Basic-ML-Task-2022-AGV
I studied from the slides of the MLFA class, made handwritten notes, did the andrewng course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning and covered the topics : 

Supervised Learning
1) Linear regression and its objective function
2) Non linear regression
3) Locally weighted regression and its objective function
4) K- nearest neighbour, distance weighted KNN, scale effects, attributes, Value Difference Metric
5) Condensed KNN
6) Logistic Regression, likelihood function, gradient ascent
7) Gradient descent for logistic regression : BGD
8) Stochastic GD
9) Mini batch SGD
10) Adagrad: adaptive GD
11) Adaptive Moment Estimation(ADAM)
12) Vectorization
13) Feature scaling
14) regularization

Deep Neural Network
1) Structure of DNN
2) Components of DNN
3) Ingredients of DNN

Some other important info i found are in this doc : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w4DW1VRIc8x0MaTGtCiOajWcWNhoNkx96KUmsmG43ck/edit?usp=sharing

Now I am currently learning python for machine learning from IITG.ai course : https://machinelearning-ai.netlify.app/
will refer to the Applied Machine Learning in Python course when necessary : https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning?specialization=data-science-python#syllabus
Currently I am studying Python implementation of ML from my MLFA lab : link to the jupyter notebooks we use: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cWOtk1R1riRWV2_FEQ1JO80-rXvySU2S?usp=sharing
